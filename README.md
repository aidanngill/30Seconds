# 30Seconds

Websocket implementation of a popular board game. This could easily be adapted into other games, as the only thing that would differ would be the `game`/`round` portion.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/ramadan8/30Seconds.git
```

### Usage
Start by initializing a new virtual environment within your cloned repository. This can be done by typing:
```
py -m venv venv
```
Once you have initialized it, you can activate it by typing:
```
# On Unix
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```
Once you are in your virtual environment, type the following in order to get the required packages for the server:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
From here, you can start the server by typing:
```
py main.py
```

## Responses

All responses from the server will be in JSON, and will follow this format:
```
{
	"s": 0/1, 				# Whether or not the action was successful
	"c": "RETURN_CODE",		# The error/success code
	"d": {					# Any data returned from the action
		"foo": "bar"
	}
}
```

### Success

Successful responses will be returned with a success value of `1`, with the following codes:

|Code|Description|
